This lab was a upgrade based on the last one. In this time, we need to added more functions.
And most improtantly, the single c file divided into different c files and header files. Applied the
knowledge about make files, library, and struictures. It was kind of 
hard at the first to make all thoes happened. But it is satisfield at the end. It is great to learning new ways
to code. It is more clear and easy to see the problems.
