Well, in this time, we are still doing changes based on PhotoLab. Our focus was to make the problem
able to process dynamic image size with the help of pointers. At first, I feel it is very hard becasue we 
need to change our mind on think about this problem. The structure is totally different compare to 
the previous one. By using malloc and free allocate, the problem is able to keep track of the pixels.
It is a challenged problem.
