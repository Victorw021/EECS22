PhotoLab basically is like a Photoshop program, and can realize certain function to change the photo.
This program required a menu driven, so I use while and switch to fulfill this requirement. 
In the switch statement, I called different function depends on user input.
Black and White:
Loop the whole array and change the intensity to (r + b + g)/3
Negative:
Loop the whole array and change use 255 to subtract the intensity value for each rgb.
ColorFilter:
Operate based on user's promt of target_r, target_g, target_b, threshold, replace_r, replace_g, replace_b, make sure it is in the range of 0-255
Change the color of the pixel within the range user prompt.
Edge:
Create a new function of the saturated arithmetic purpose. Calculate the 8 values for surrounding pixel and change the intensity values of them. Use thew saturated function at the end.
Shuffle:
generate an random number, and use it to random generate the 16 pieces of picture. 
VFlip:
Use temp variable  to copy and replace the value in the array. Centered by the middle line, so we use Height/2 in the loop. 
Vmirror:
Copy the value from up side to the down side.
Add border:
Ask the user with the color they want and the width of the border. Assigned the pixel at the border position to be the specific color.
Overall, it is important to know the for loop, and the knowledge of array.
